# Exploring-Weather-Trends-

In this project,
we will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where we live to overall global temperature trends.

Also, in This project we will do the following steps:

Extract data from a database using a SQL query
Calculate a moving average in a spreadsheet
Create a line chart in a spreadsheet

Finally , create a visualization and prepare a write up describing 
the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the  city we choose.
